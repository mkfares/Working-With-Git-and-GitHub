### Create a console application
1. Change to the directory where your project is located
```console
$ cd Dot-Net-Core-Entity-Framework
```
2. Create a console project with the same name as your current directory
```console
$ dotnet new console
```

3. Run the project (build, restore, and run)
```console
$ dotnet run
```

After running the project, you should get "Hello World"

### Commit changes to your GitHub repository
```console
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Create Project"
$ git push origin master
```
